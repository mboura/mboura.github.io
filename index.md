# Welcome!

As a PhD-trained data scientist and ecologist with over 9 years of expertise, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights. My passion lies at the intersection of spatial data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization applied to ecological studies.
With a strong interdisciplinary background in statistics, spatial analysis, and ecology, I work at the interface of data science and biodiversity conservation. My career spans academic research and consultancy, with a focus on wildlife, urban nature, and ecological networks. 
My research interests are in urban ecology and landscape ecology, forestry, biodiversity conservation, biodiversity monitoring, ecosystem services and urban patterns. I also have a keen interest in modelling and (interactive) data visualisation.

Since 2014, Iâ€™ve been involved in teaching and mentoring, including university-level courses in statistics, spatial statistics, and R programming (in France, Luxembourg and Belgium).

**Technical skills**

- Programming: R, Python, Bash, SQL, with previous experience in MATLAB, SAS and Stata.
