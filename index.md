# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at UCLouvain, currently working in the project CO-HABITAT: Towards animal-inclusive design strategies in the Brussels Capital Region. I hold a PhD in Geography from the University of Luxembourg since 2021.

My research interests are in urban ecology and landscape, urban forestry, urban biodiversity, ecosystem services and urban patterns. I also have a keen interest in modelling and data visualisation.
