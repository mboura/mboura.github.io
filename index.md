# Welcome!

As a PhD-trained data scientist and ecologist with over 9 years of expertise, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights. My passion lies at the intersection of spatial data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization applied to ecological studies.
With a strong interdisciplinary background in statistics, spatial analysis, and ecology, I work at the interface of data science and biodiversity conservation. My career spans academic research and consultancy, with a focus on wildlife, urban nature, and ecological networks. 
My research interests are in urban ecology and landscape ecology, forestry, biodiversity conservation, biodiversity monitoring, ecosystem services and urban patterns. I also have a keen interest in modelling and (interactive) data visualisation.

My PhD research explored urban ecology, focusing on how the spatial integration of urban vegetation—urban forests—affects ecosystem services across European cities. As a postdoctoral researcher, I studied human–wildlife interactions in the Brussels Region, analysing the dynamics of urban fauna cohabiting with humans and the built environment.
I currently support public and private actors in biodiversity and ecological transition projects. My work includes:
- Reducing bat and bird mortality near wind turbines through adaptive curtailment strategies and real-time detection technologies
- Strengthening ecological networks and landscape connectivity using spatial modeling tools
- Conducting environmental impact assessments (fauna, flora, habitats) and proposing mitigation strategies
- Supporting data governance and developing semi-automated or interactive tools for internal and client projects

Since 2014, I’ve been involved in teaching and mentoring, including university-level courses in statistics, spatial statistics, and R programming (in France, Luxembourg and Belgium).
