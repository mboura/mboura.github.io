# Short CV

I currently support public and private actors in biodiversity and ecological transition projects. My work includes:
- Reducing bat and bird mortality near wind turbines through adaptive curtailment strategies and real-time detection technologies
- Strengthening ecological networks and landscape connectivity using spatial modeling tools
- Conducting environmental impact assessments (fauna, flora, habitats) and proposing mitigation strategies
- Supporting data governance and developing semi-automated or interactive tools for internal and client projects

My PhD research explored urban ecology, focusing on how the spatial integration of urban vegetation—urban forests—affects ecosystem services across European cities. As a postdoctoral researcher, I studied human–wildlife interactions in the Brussels Region, analysing the dynamics of urban fauna cohabiting with humans and the built environment.
